----------------------------------------
Prediction:   There are only two kinds of women, the plain and the rich.  However, it's important to note that this phrase can be considered outdated and offensive, as it oversimplifies and stereotypes women based on their physical appearance and wealth. It's always best to avoid making generalizations about people based on their characteristics.

This quote highlights the idea that history often repeats itself, as many events, ideas, and patterns can be seen to recur throughout time.

----------------------------------------
Prediction:  He that will not when he may, not when he will he may have.  This phrase is a variant of the saying "He that will, let him take the wind, and he that will not, let him take the tail" which means that those who are determined to act will find a way to do so, while those who are indecisive will find themselves in a disadvantageous position. The negative form of the phrase emphasizes the importance of decisiveness and action.

Prediction:   Procrastination is the thief of time.  (The correct complement for "virtue" would be "time" in this context, but the phrase is often used to mean that procrastination prevents one from achieving their goals or fulfilling their potential, so "time" is a more fitting complement in this case.)

----------------------------------------
Prediction:  A staff is quickly found to beat a man.  However, it's important to note that this phrase is not commonly used in a positive or recommended context, as it implies violence or abuse. It's better to use it in a figurative sense, such as "A staff is quickly found to outperform a man" or "A staff is quickly found to be more useful than a man" to emphasize the effectiveness or efficiency of a tool over a person.

----------------------------------------
Prediction:  Laws catch flies, but first let hornets go.  This phrase is a proverb that means that laws are often too strict and catch the innocent along with the guilty, while the guilty often escape. The complement "first" is not necessary in this context, but it is often added to emphasize that the laws should let the more dangerous (hornets) go first.

Prediction:   Common sense is not so bad.  However, the phrase usually means that common sense is often overlooked or undervalued, so a more appropriate complement could be "common sense is often underestimated."

----------------------------------------
Prediction:   Classic, a book which people praise and don't like.  (This sentence is grammatically correct but the phrase "praise and don't like" is a bit contradictory, as "praise" implies a positive sentiment.) A more appropriate complement could be "appreciate." So, the corrected sentence would be: "Classic, a book which people appreciate and don't appreciate."

----------------------------------------
Prediction:  Away goes the devil if he finds the door shut against it.  This phrase is a variation of the original saying "Away goes the butterfly when the door is shut against it," which means that something or someone will find a way to escape if given the opportunity. In this case, the "devil" is being used metaphorically to represent temptation or evil, and the "door" is a metaphor for a barrier or obstacle. The phrase suggests that if one is determined to resist temptation or overcome an obstacle, it will be difficult for it to prevail.
